TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
    any valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript
    TypeScript has strongly typed variables which allows compiler checks 
        and intellisense for compile errors

    TypeScript adds type annotations to JavaScript 
        it will check thta you've been using variables properly 
        according to their types, but only at the stage when TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript 
    
    npx tsc --init: creates the tsconfig.json file 
    npm run build: compiles the code 

    Interfaces in TypeScript 
        purely for type checking, interfaces don't exist in the js 
    
    TypeScript uses type inference like var in C#

    Modules
        a TypeScript file that has an import or export statement 
        a module has module scope and not in global scope 
        you must import everthing you want that was exported 
            import{exported item} from "filepath"
        you prefix what you want to be visible to other files with export 
            if you only want to export one thing from a module use export default
                you don't need brackets in the import statement if you do this 

        module bundler
            takes many modules and combines them into one js file 
            webpack is used by Angular to do this 
            npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
            webpack.config.js 
                configures how the modules will be bundled together 
            run webpack
