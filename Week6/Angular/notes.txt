CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    you can't use xmlhttprequest, fetch, etc. to send request to another server that isn't the server hosting your application
    CORS allows some cross-origin requests and rejects others 
    configure it in the startup file
        define policies in the configure services method 
        
         
Angular
    single-page application
        javascript handles the views all on one page without creating a whole new page 
    
    typeScript to javascript

    NgModules (aka modules) - the compilation context for components (a TS class)

        components - a reuable class that manages one part of the page 

            template - the HTML + angular stuff 
                HTML - which the component is in the DOM

                data binding - how you connect data in the component to the DOM  

                pipes 
                directives 

Services in angular
    class with an injectable module 

    3 lifetimes 
        1. providedIn: 'root' - singleton 
            registering it for the whole app 
        2. (on a module:) providers: [TheService]
            one instance of the service within that module 
        3. (on a component:) providers: [TheService]
            one instance for each instance of that component

        but whichever lifetime it has, it does need Injectable decorator on it to make it an angular service

        sometimes to use a service you need to import its module in the module you to use it 
            e.g.: import HttpClientModule
    
    HttpClient methods
        import {HttpClient} from @angular/common/http 

        get<Tclass or Tinterface>(baseUrl/apiRoute).toPromise();

Angular Components 
    The components are created and destroyed as user navigates through app 
    the lifecycle has hooks that you can put code on the most common is onInit 
        ngOnInit runs after angular has wired up this objec to the data binding in the DOM based on its template 
    The constructor is just for setup that doesn't relate to the template 
    ngOnInit is for the stuff that does 

In the template, every public memeber of component class is accessible
    directives 
        *ngIf
        *ngFor
        *ngSwitch 

        *ngFor="let item of items"

Testing 
    https://angular.io/guide/testing 
    two pieces of software work together to support angular testing 
    1. karma - test runner application 
        handle launching browsers, executing the tests in those browsers 
        and gathering the results into reports, code coverage, etc. 
    2. jasmine - test library 
        define & implement all the functions, objects, etc.
        in this file, describe, beforeEach, it, expect 
    
    neither of these are specific to angular, they are common testing tools in 
    the JS ecosystem they are the default 

    the spec file structure: 
        describe(subjectUnderTest, functionWithAllTheSpecs)

        "it"(what the subjectUnderTest should do, function)

        expect() - the outcome of the test  

    use spy objects to take the place of actual dependencies of the component
