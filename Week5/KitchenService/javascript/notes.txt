JavaScript
    not truly OO language 
    "object-based"
    
    weakly/loosely typed 
    in JS, variables do not have a type 
        values do have types, but any variable can contain any type 
        objects in JS can have properties on them added or removed at runtime 
    JS is interpreted, not compiled - executed as it is read 

    JS is technically ECHMAScript aka ES 

    Data types
        number 
            same datatype for whole numbers and fractional 
            basically a double-precision IEEE floating-point number 
        typeof returns a string representing a type 

        boolean 
            Nan always compares false
        
        string 
            single or double quotes 
            string functions 

        null
            considered its own data type 
            typeof says null is object type but its not 
        
        undefined 
            a data type with one possible value
            if you don't define a variable, undefined is the default value 
            it's also the return value of functions that don't mean anything 
                (no void return)
        
        object 
            {} - object literal 
            you can delete and add properties to objects 
                properties in JS are like fields in C# 
            arrays are object with builtin methods 
            functions
                typeof for functions says function but it is an object 
                arrow functions aka lambda expressions in C# 
                    let multiply = (a,b) => a*b;

        debugger; used as a break point 
    
    Scope
       two possible scopes 
        global/document 
            in scope everywhere after the line its assigned (including in other script files)
        function scope 
            in scope anywhere in the function in which it was declared 
            including before it was declared and outside the block it was declared 
        
        ES5 added strict mode 
            any function or file with the string "use strict" as the first expression opts
                in to better behavior:
                    - not allowed to assign to variable without explicitly declaring it 
                    - not allowed to assign to global scope from inside a function 
        
        ES6 added block scope
            via new ways to declare variables besides var: "let" and "const"
    
    Type Conversions
        JS does "implicit conversions" very freely 
        there's rules for how and when all these conversions happen
            rules for converting anything to boolean 
                any value that converts to true in a boolean context is "truthy"
                the others are "falsey"

                Falsey:
                    0, -0
                    NaN 
                    undefined 
                    null
                    false 
                    '' empty string 
                everything else including the string "false", empty array , all objects, are all truthy 
                
                comparison with equals operators in JS 
                double equals aka loose equality ==
                triple equals aka strict equality ===
