HTTP request and response
    response    
        HTML file -> rendered by user's browser 
        other files like CSS, JS, image
        redirection(302 status code) - broweser will request a different URL 
        error page(HTML file) 

    request to a URL
        input can be:
            from user clicking links
                - in the URL:
                    part of the path or part of the query string (?a=b&c=d) 
            from browser submits form     
                - in the body 

We need a web server or at least something that acts like one
    software that waits for HTTP requests, and run logic that we control to send
        back HTTP responses 

2 simple implementations: 
    - automatically respond to every request with "hello world" HTML
    - for every request, look at the URL, interpret it as a relative path on the file system, and return that file 

ASP.NET Core
    framework for any kind of app that handles HTTP requests 

1. routing - which controller, and which action method in the controller 
2. instantiate the controllere and call the method 
3. action method executes (our code)
    return some IActionResult object
4. result execution (serialization)
    the result object is written to the HTTP response and sent 

MVC (Model View Controller) Design Pattern

    3 service lifetimes:
        1. singleton: one instance for the whole app lifetimes
        2. scoped: one instance per HTTP request cycle, shared by anthing within that one request's scope 
            (default)
        3. transient: a new instance for every time a different object needs one 

Convention-based Routing (global routing)
    general route path for many controllers(user-defined)
Attribute routing 
    uses route attributes on action methods 
    [Route] can specify the path to call the specific action 
    ex) [HttpPost] , [HttpGet] 
    Attribute routing separates the route from the global routing 

Filters
    kind of like helper methods for MVC 
    way to avoid repeating yourself in your action method 
    Ex) authorization filters, resource filters, action filters, exception filters, result filters
