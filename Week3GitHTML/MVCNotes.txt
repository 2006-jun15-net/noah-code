HTTP request and response
    response    
        HTML file -> rendered by user's browser 
        other files like CSS, JS, image
        redirection(302 status code) - broweser will request a different URL 
        error page(HTML file) 

    request to a URL
        input can be:
            from user clicking links
                - in the URL:
                    part of the path or part of the query string (?a=b&c=d) 
            from browser submits form     
                - in the body 

We need a web server or at least something that acts like one
    software that waits for HTTP requests, and run logic that we control to send
        back HTTP responses 

2 simple implementations: 
    - automatically respond to every request with "hello world" HTML
    - for every request, look at the URL, interpret it as a relative path on the file system, and return that file
