    Branches
        represents a line of development, one line tracing back through commit history
        concretely, it's just a named pointer to one particular commit, which will move 
            forward on new commits
        
        origin/master
            remote-tracking branch which is "read-only" that showws the most updated view
                of what origin has for master 
            updated with git fetch or git pull or git push 

        HEAD - the commit you're on now (you can move away from a branch to some commit in the history
            - this is called "detached HEAD")

        git pull = git fetch + git merge

        merge   
            merging some other branch into the current branch
            by defalut, the remote-tracking counterpart of this branch e.g. origin/master

            given all the changes the other branch has and this one doesn't, make a new commit adding those changes
